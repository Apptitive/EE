<h4>Claim / Reason for Referral to Insurer:</h4>
<h5>Claim Recommendation</h5>

<!--Static text here for this template-->
<p id="ReasonForReferral">
	The exact cause for the garage ceiling collapse is difficult to determine. It is likely due to a number of contributing factors.
	</br>The garage ceiling is subject to moisture, wind, vibrations due to the roller/panel door and combined with insufficient fixing of the perimeter of the ceiling these factors together can contribute to the collapse of the garage ceiling.
	</br>As a result the exact cause of the ceiling collapsed is unable to be established. A copy of the garage ceiling collapse and festooning report has been uploaded as an attachment for the insurer’s reference on the common issues found as a result of these ceiling collapses.
	</br>The claim is recommended as "Do Not Accept - Not Covered" as no defined claimable event appears to have taken place which has directly resulted in the failure of the garage ceiling.
